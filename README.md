# Sentiment-analysis-on-twitter-data
Overview
A simple sentiment analysis project using Logistic Regression. The script includes a small built-in sample dataset so it runs offline.

Files
- `sentiment_analysis.py` : Main runnable script.
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies.

Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

Extend
- Replace the sample data with a CSV of tweets and labels.
- Use NLTK or spaCy for advanced preprocessing.
- Connect to Twitter API (developer access required) to fetch real tweets.
